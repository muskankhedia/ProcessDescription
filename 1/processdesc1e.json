It is used to create, display, modify and otherwise manipulate text files. red is a restricted ed: it can only edit files in the current directory and cannot execute shell commands. If invoked with a file argument, then a copy of file is read into the editor's buffer. Changes are made to this copy and not directly to file itself. Upon quitting ed, any changes not explicitly saved with a 'w' command are lost. Editing is done in two distinct modes: command and input. When first invoked, ed is in command mode. In this mode commands are read from the standard input and executed to manipulate the contents of the editor buffer. A typical command might look like: ,s\/ old\/ new\/g which replaces all occurrences of the string old with new. When an input command, such as 'a' (append), 'i' (insert) or 'c' (change), is given, ed enters input mode. This is the primary means of adding text to a file. In this mode, no commands are available; instead, the standard input is written directly to the editor buffer. Lines consist of text up to and including a newline character. Input mode is terminated by entering a single period (.) on a line. All ed commands operate on whole lines or ranges of lines; e.g., the 'd' command deletes lines; the 'm' command moves lines, and so on. It is possible to modify only a portion of a line by means of replacement, as in the example above. However even here, the 's' command is applied to whole lines at a time. In general, ed commands consist of zero or more line addresses, followed by a single character command and possibly additional parameters; i.e., commands have the structure: [address [,address]]command[parameters] The address(es) indicate the line or range of lines to be affected by the command. If fewer addresses are given than the command accepts, then default addresses are supplied. OPTIONS -G Forces backwards compatibility. Affects the commands 'G', 'V', 'f', 'l', 'm', 't', and '!!'. -s Suppresses diagnostics. This should be used if ed's standard input is from a script. -p string Specifies a command prompt. This may be toggled on and off with the 'P' command. file Specifies the name of a file to read. If file is prefixed with a bang (!), then it is interpreted as a shell command. In this case, what is read is the standard output of file executed via sh(1). To read a file whose name begins with a bang, prefix the name with a backslash (\\). The default filename is set to file only if it is not prefixed with a bang. LINE ADDRESSING An address represents the number of a line in the buffer. ed maintains a current address which is typically supplied to commands as the default address when none is specified. When a file is first read, the current address is set to the last line of the file. In general, the current address is set to the last line affected by a command. A line address is constructed from one of the bases in the list below, optionally followed by a numeric offset. The offset may include any combination of digits, operators (i.e. + and -) and whitespace. Addresses are read from left to right, and their values are computed relative to the current address. One exception to the rule that addresses represent line numbers is the address 0 (zero). This means \"before the first line,\" and is legal wherever it makes sense. An address range is two addresses separated either by a comma or semicolon. The value of the first address in a range cannot exceed the value of the the second. If only one address is given in a range, then the second address is set to the given address. If an n-tuple of addresses is given where n > 2, then the corresponding range is determined by the last two addresses in the n-tuple. If only one address is expected, then the last address is used. Each address in a comma-delimited range is interpreted relative to the current address. In a semicolon-delimited range, the first address is used to set the current address, and the second address is interpreted relative to the first. The following address symbols are recognized. . The current line (address) in the buffer. $ The last line in the buffer. n The nth, line in the buffer where n is a number in the range [0,$]. - The previous line. This is equivalent to -1 and may be repeated with cumulative effect. ^n The nth previous line, where n is a non-negative number. + The next line. This is equivalent to +1 and may be repeated with cumulative effect. whitespace n + n The nth next line, where n is a non-negative number. Whitespace followed by a number n is interpreted as +n. , The first through last lines in the buffer. This is equivalent to the address range 1,$. ; The current through last lines in the buffer. This is equivalent to the address range .,$. \/re\/ The next line containing the regular expression re. The search wraps to the beginning of the buffer and continues down to the current line, if necessary. \/\/ repeats the last search. ?re? The previous line containing the regular expression re. The search wraps to the end of the buffer and continues up to the current line, if necessary. ?? repeats the last search. 'lc The line previously marked by a 'k' (mark) command, where lc is a lower case letter. REGULAR EXPRESSIONS Regular expressions are patterns used in selecting text. For example, the ed command g\/ string\/ prints all lines containing string. Regular expressions are also used by the 's' command for selecting old text to be replaced with new. In addition to a specifying string literals, regular expressions can represent classes of strings. Strings thus represented are said to be matched by the corresponding regular expression. If it is possible for a regular expression to match several strings in a line, then the left-most longest match is the one selected. The following symbols are used in constructing regular expressions: c Any character c not listed below, including '{', '}', '(', ')', '<' and '>', matches itself. \\c A backslash-escaped character c other than '{', '}', '(', ')', '<', '>', 'b', 'B', 'w', 'W', '+', and '?' matches itself. . Matches any single character. [char-class] Matches any single character in char-class. To include a ']' in char-class, it must be the first character. A range of characters may be specified by separating the end characters of the range with a '-', e.g., 'a-z' specifies the lower case characters. The following literal expressions can also be used in char-class to specify sets of characters: [:alnum:]  [:cntrl:]  [:lower:]  [:space:]\n[:alpha:]  [:digit:]  [:print:]  [:upper:]\n[:blank:]  [:graph:]  [:punct:]  [:xdigit:] If '-' appears as the first or last character of char-class, then it matches itself. All other characters in char-class match themselves. Patterns in char-class of the form: [.col-elm.] or, [=col-elm=] where col-elm is a collating element are interpreted according to locale(5) (not currently supported). See regex(3) for an explanation of these constructs. [^ char-class] Matches any single character, other than newline, not in char-class. char-class is defined as above. ^ If '^' is the first character of a regular expression, then it anchors the regular expression to the beginning of a line. Otherwise, it matches itself. $ If '$' is the last character of a regular expression, it anchors the regular expression to the end of a line. Otherwise, it matches itself. \\(re\\) Defines a (possibly null) subexpression re. Subexpressions may be nested. A subsequent backreference of the form '\\n', where n is a number in the range [1,9], expands to the text matched by the nth subexpression. For example, the regular expression '\\(a.c\\)\\1' matches the string 'abcabc', but not 'abcadc'. Subexpressions are ordered relative to their left delimiter. * Matches the single character regular expression or subexpression immediately preceding it zero or more times. If '*' is the first character of a regular expression or subexpression, then it matches itself. The '*' operator sometimes yields unexpected results. For example, the regular expression 'b*' matches the beginning of the string 'abbb', as opposed to the substring 'bbb', since a null match is the only left-most match. \\{ n,m\\} \\{ n,\\} \\{ n\\} Matches the single character regular expression or subexpression immediately preceding it at least n and at most m times. If m is omitted, then it matches at least n times. If the comma is also omitted, then it matches exactly n times. If any of these forms occurs first in a regular expression or subexpression, then it is interpreted literally (i.e., the regular expression '\\{2\\}' matches the string '{2}', and so on). \\< \\> Anchors the single character regular expression or subexpression immediately following it to the beginning (\\<) or ending (\\>) of a word, i.e., in ASCII, a maximal string of alphanumeric characters, including the underscore (_). The following extended operators are preceded by a backslash (\\) to distinguish them from traditional ed syntax. \\' \\' Unconditionally matches the beginning (\\') or ending (\\') of a line. \\? Optionally matches the single character regular expression or subexpression immediately preceding it. For example, the regular expression 'a[bd]\\?c' matches the strings 'abc', 'adc' and 'ac'. If \\? occurs at the beginning of a regular expressions or subexpression, then it matches a literal '?'. \\+ Matches the single character regular expression or subexpression immediately preceding it one or more times. So the regular expression 'a\\+' is shorthand for 'aa*'. If \\+ occurs at the beginning of a regular expression or subexpression, then it matches a literal '+'. \\b Matches the beginning or ending (null string) of a word. Thus the regular expression '\\bhello\\b' is equivalent to '\\<hello\\>'. However, '\\b\\b' is a valid regular expression whereas '\\<\\>' is not. \\B Matches (a null string) inside a word. \\w Matches any character in a word. \\W Matches any character not in a word. COMMANDS All ed commands are single characters, though some require additional parameters. If a command's parameters extend over several lines, then each line except for the last must be terminated with a backslash (\\). In general, at most one command is allowed per line. However, most commands accept a print suffix, which is any of 'p' (print), 'l' (list) , or 'n' (enumerate), to print the last line affected by the command. An interrupt (typically ^C) has the effect of aborting the current command and returning the editor to command mode. ed recognizes the following commands. The commands are shown together with the default address or address range supplied if none is specified (in parenthesis). (.)a Appends text to the buffer after the addressed line, which may be the address 0 (zero). Text is entered in input mode. The current address is set to last line entered. (.,.)c Changes lines in the buffer. The addressed lines are deleted from the buffer, and text is appended in their place. Text is entered in input mode. The current address is set to last line entered. (.,.)d Deletes the addressed lines from the buffer. If there is a line after the deleted range, then the current address is set to this line. Otherwise the current address is set to the line before the deleted range. e file Edits file, and sets the default filename. If file is not specified, then the default filename is used. Any lines in the buffer are deleted before the new file is read. The current address is set to the last line read. e ! command Edits the standard output of '!command', (see ! command below). The default filename is unchanged. Any lines in the buffer are deleted before the output of command is read. The current address is set to the last line read. E file Edits file unconditionally. This is similar to the e command, except that unwritten changes are discarded without warning. The current address is set to the last line read. f file Sets the default filename to file. If file is not specified, then the default unescaped filename is printed. (1,$)g \/re\/command-list Applies command-list to each of the addressed lines matching a regular expression re. The current address is set to the line currently matched before command-list is executed. At the end of the 'g' command, the current address is set to the last line affected by command-list. Each command in command-list must be on a separate line, and every line except for the last must be terminated by a backslash (\\). Any commands are allowed, except for 'g', 'G', 'v', and 'V'. A newline alone in command-list is equivalent to a 'p' command. (1,$)G \/re\/ Interactively edits the addressed lines matching a regular expression re. For each matching line, the line is printed, the current address is set, and the user is prompted to enter a command-list. At the end of the 'G' command, the current address is set to the last line affected by (the last) command-list. The format of command-list is the same as that of the 'g' command. A newline alone acts as a null command list. A single '&' repeats the last non-null command list. H Toggles the printing of error explanations. By default, explanations are not printed. It is recommended that ed scripts begin with this command to aid in debugging. h Prints an explanation of the last error. (.)i Inserts text in the buffer before the current line. Text is entered in input mode. The current address is set to the last line entered. (.,.+1)j Joins the addressed lines. The addressed lines are deleted from the buffer and replaced by a single line containing their joined text. The current address is set to the resultant line. (.)k lc Marks a line with a lower case letter lc. The line can then be addressed as 'lc (i.e., a single quote followed by lc ) in subsequent commands. The mark is not cleared until the line is deleted or otherwise modified. (.,.)l Prints the addressed lines unambiguously. If invoked from a terminal, ed pauses at the end of each page until a newline is entered. The current address is set to the last line printed. (.,.)m(.) Moves lines in the buffer. The addressed lines are moved to after the right-hand destination address, which may be the address 0 (zero). The current address is set to the last line moved. (.,.)n Prints the addressed lines along with their line numbers. The current address is set to the last line printed. (.,.)p Prints the addressed lines. If invoked from a terminal, ed pauses at the end of each page until a newline is entered. The current address is set to the last line printed. P Toggles the command prompt on and off. Unless a prompt was specified by with command-line option -p string, the command prompt is by default turned off. q Quits ed. Q Quits ed unconditionally. This is similar to the q command, except that unwritten changes are discarded without warning. ($)r file Reads file to after the addressed line. If file is not specified, then the default filename is used. If there was no default filename prior to the command, then the default filename is set to file. Otherwise, the default filename is unchanged. The current address is set to the last line read. ($)r ! command Reads to after the addressed line the standard output of '!command', (see the ! command below). The default filename is unchanged. The current address is set to the last line read. (.,.)s \/re\/replacement\/ (.,.)s \/re\/replacement\/g (.,.)s \/re\/replacement\/n Replaces text in the addressed lines matching a regular expression re with replacement. By default, only the first match in each line is replaced. If the 'g' (global) suffix is given, then every match to be replaced. The 'n' suffix, where n is a positive number, causes only the nth match to be replaced. It is an error if no substitutions are performed on any of the addressed lines. The current address is set the last line affected. re and replacement may be delimited by any character other than space and newline (see the 's' command below). If one or two of the last delimiters is omitted, then the last line affected is printed as though the print suffix 'p' were specified. An unescaped '&' in replacement is replaced by the currently matched text. The character sequence '\\m', where m is a number in the range [1,9], is replaced by the mth backreference expression of the matched text. If replacement consists of a single '%', then replacement from the last substitution is used. Newlines may be embedded in replacement if they are escaped with a backslash (\\). (.,.)s Repeats the last substitution. This form of the 's' command accepts a count suffix 'n', or any combination of the characters 'r', 'g', and 'p'. If a count suffix 'n' is given, then only the nth match is replaced. The 'r' suffix causes the regular expression of the last search to be used instead of the that of the last substitution. The 'g' suffix toggles the global suffix of the last substitution. The 'p' suffix toggles the print suffix of the last substitution. The current address is set to the last line affected. (.,.)t(.) Copies (i.e., transfers) the addressed lines to after the right-hand destination address, which may be the address 0 (zero). The current address is set to the last line copied. u Undoes the last command and restores the current address to what it was before the command. The global commands 'g', 'G', 'v', and 'V'. are treated as a single command by undo. 'u' is its own inverse. (1,$)v \/re\/command-list Applies command-list to each of the addressed lines not matching a regular expression re. This is similar to the 'g' command. (1,$)V \/re\/ Interactively edits the addressed lines not matching a regular expression re. This is similar to the 'G' command. (1,$)w file Writes the addressed lines to file. Any previous contents of file is lost without warning. If there is no default filename, then the default filename is set to file, otherwise it is unchanged. If no filename is specified, then the default filename is used. The current address is unchanged. (1,$)wq file Writes the addressed lines to file, and then executes a 'q' command. (1,$)w ! command Writes the addressed lines to the standard input of '!command', (see the ! command below). The default filename and current address are unchanged. (1,$)W file Appends the addressed lines to the end of file. This is similar to the 'w' command, expect that the previous contents of file is not clobbered. The current address is unchanged. (.)x Copies (puts) the contents of the cut buffer to after the addressed line. The current address is set to the last line copied. (.,.)y Copies (yanks) the addressed lines to the cut buffer. The cut buffer is overwritten by subsequent 'y', 's', 'j', 'd', or 'c' commands. The current address is unchanged. (.+1)zn Scrolls n lines at a time starting at addressed line. If n is not specified, then the current window size is used. The current address is set to the last line printed. ! command Executes command via sh(1). If the first character of command is '!', then it is replaced by text of the previous '!command'. ed does not process command for backslash (\\) escapes. However, an unescaped '%' is replaced by the default filename. When the shell returns from execution, a '!' is printed to the standard output. The current line is unchanged. (.,.)# Begins a comment; the rest of the line, up to a newline, is ignored. If a line address followed by a semicolon is given, then the current address is set to that address. Otherwise, the current address is unchanged. ($)= Prints the line number of the addressed line.

It is always in text insertion mode unless there is a prompt at the bottom of the terminal, or a menu present (in a box in the middle of the terminal). The command ree is the same as ee, but restricted to editing the named file (no file operations, or shell escapes are allowed). An editor with similar user-friendly qualities but more features is available and is called aee. For ee to work properly, the environment variable TERM must be set to indicate the type of terminal being used. For example, for an HP 700\/92 terminal, the TERM variable should be set to \"70092\". See your System Administrator if you need more information. Options The following options are available from the command line: -e Turns off expansion of tab character to spaces. -i Turns off display of information window at top of terminal. -h Turns off highlighting of borders of windows and menus (improves performance on some terminals). +# Moves the cursor to line '#' at startup. Control keys To do anything other than insert text, the user must use the control keys (the Control key, represented by a \"^\", pressed in conjunction with an alphabetic key, e.g., ^a) and function keys available on the keyboard (such as Next Page, Prev Page, arrow keys, etc.). Since not all terminals have function keys, ee has the basic cursor movement functions assigned to control keys as well as more intuitive keys on the keyboard when available. For instance, to move the cursor up, the user can use the up arrow key, or ^u. ^a            Prompt for the decimal value of a character to insert. ^b Move to the bottom of the text. ^c Get the prompt for a command. ^d Move the cursor down. ^e Prompt for the string to search for. ^f Undelete the last deleted character. ^g Move to the beginning of the line. ^h Backspace. ^i Tab. ^j Insert a newline. ^k Delete the character the cursor is sitting on. ^l Move the cursor left. ^m Insert a newline. ^n Move to the next page. ^o Move to the end of the line. ^p Move to the previous page. ^r Move the cursor to the right. ^t Move to the top of the text. ^u Move the cursor up. ^v Undelete the last deleted word. ^w Delete the word beginning at the cursor position. ^x Search. ^y Delete from the cursor position to the end of line. ^z Undelete the last deleted line. ^[ (ESC) Pop up menu. EMACS keys mode Since many shells provide an Emacs mode (for cursor movement and other editing operations), some bindings that may be more useful for people familiar with those bindings have been provided. These are accessible via the settings menu, or via the initialization file (see below). The mappings are as follows: ^a            Move to the beginning of the line. ^b Back 1 character. ^c Command prompt. ^d Delete character the cursor is sitting on. ^e End of line. ^f Forward 1 character. ^g Go back 1 page. ^h Backspace. ^i Tab. ^j Undelete last deleted character. ^k Delete line. ^l Undelete last deleted line. ^m Insert a newline. ^n Move to the next line. ^o Prompt for the decimal value of a character to insert. ^p Previous line. ^r Restore last deleted word. ^t Move to the top of the text. ^u Move to the bottom of the text. ^v Move to the next page. ^w Delete the word beginning at the cursor position. ^y Prompt for the string to search for. ^z Next word. ^[ (ESC) Pop up menu. Function Keys Next Page Move to the next page. Prev Page Move to the previous page. Delete Char Delete the character the cursor is on. Delete Line Delete from the cursor to the end of line. Insert line Insert a newline at the cursor position. Arrow keys Move the cursor in the direction indicated. Commands Some operations require more information than a single keystroke can provide. For the most basic operations, there is a menu that can be obtained by pressing the ESC key. The same operations, and more can be performed by obtaining the command prompt (^c) and typing in one of the commands below. ! cmd Execute cmd in a shell. 0-9 Move to the line indicated. case Make searches case sensitive. character Display the ascii value of the character at the cursor. exit Save the edited text, and leave the editor. expand Expand tabs to spaces. file Print the name of the file. help Display help screen. line Display the current line number. nocase Make searches insensitive to case (the default). noexpand Don't expand tab to spaces when the TAB key is pressed. quit Leave the editor without saving changes. read file Read the named file. write file Write the text to the named file. Menu Operations Pop-up menus can be obtained by pressing the escape key (or ^[ if no escape key is present). When in the menu, the escape key can be used to leave the menu without performing any operations. Use the up and down arrow keys, or ^u for moving up and ^d for moving down to move to the desired items in the menu, then press return to perform the indicated task. To the left of each menu item is a letter, which if the corresponding letter is pressed on the keyboard selects that menu entry. The main menu in ee is as follows: leave editor If changes have been made, the user will get a menu prompting whether or not the changes should be saved. help Displays a help screen, with all of the keyboard operations and commands. file operations Pops up a menu for selecting whether to read a file, write to a file, or save the current contents of the editor, as well as send the contents of the editor to a print command (see the section Initializing ee from a file). redraw screen Provides a means to repaint the screen if the screen has been corrupted. settings Shows the current values of the operating modes, and right margin. By pressing return when the cursor is on a particular item, the value can be changed. To leave this menu, press the escape key. (See Modes below.) search Pops up a menu in which the user may choose to enter a string to search for, or search for a string already entered. miscellaneous Pops up a menu that allows the user to format the current paragraph, execute a shell command, or check the spelling of the text in the editor. Paragraph Formatting Paragraphs are defined for ee by a block of text bounded by: \u2022 Begin or end of file. \u2022 Line with no characters, or only spaces and\/or tabs. \u2022 Line starting with a period ('.') or right angle bracket ('>'). A paragraph may be formatted two ways: explicitly by choosing the format paragraph menu item, or by setting ee to automatically format paragraphs. The automatic mode may be set via a menu, or via the initialization file. There are three states for text operation in ee: free-form, margins, and automatic formatting. \"Free-form\" is best used for things like programming. There are no restrictions on the length of lines, and no formatting takes place. \"Margins\" allows the user to type in text without having to worry about going beyond the right margin (the right margin may be set in the settings menu, the default is for the margin to be the right edge of the terminal). This is the mode that allows the format paragraph menu item to work. \"Automatic formatting\" provides word-processor-like behavior. The user may type in text, while ee will make sure the entire paragraph fits within the width of the terminal every time the user inserts a space after typing or deleting text. Margin observation must also be enabled in order for automatic formatting to occur. Modes Although ee is a 'modeless' editor (it is in text insertion mode all the time), there are modes in some of the things it does. These include: tab expansion Tabs may be inserted as a single tab character, or replaced with spaces. case sensitivity The search operation can be sensitive to whether characters are upper- or lower-case, or ignore case completely. margins observed Lines can either be truncated at the right margin, or extend on forever. auto paragraph formatting While typing in text, the editor can try to keep it looking reasonably well within the width of the screen. eightbit characters Toggles whether eight bit characters are displayed as their value in angle brackets (e.g. \"<220>\") or as a character. info window A window showing the keyboard operations that can be performed can be displayed or not. emacs keys Control keys may be given bindings similar to emacs, or not. 6 bit characters Toggles whether sixteen bit characters are handled as one 16-bit quantities or two 8-bit quantities. This works primarily with the Chinese Big 5 code set. You may set these modes via the initialization file (see below), or with a menu (see above). Spell Checking There are two ways to have the spelling in the text checked from ee. One is by the traditional spell(1) command, the other is with the optional ispell(1) command. Using spell, the words that are not recognized will be placed at the top of the file. For the ispell option, the file is written to disk, then ispell run on the file, and the file read back in once ispell has completed making changes to the file. Printing the contents of the editor The user may select a menu item which prints the contents of the editor. ee pipes the text in the editor to the command specified by the initialization command printcommand (see the section Initializing ee from a file below). The default is to send the contents to \"lp\". Whatever the user assigns to printcommand must take input from standard input. See your system administrator for more details. Shell operations Shell commands can be executed from within ee by selecting the shell command item in the miscellaneous menu, or by placing an exclamation mark (\"!\") before the command to execute at the command: prompt. Additionally, the user may direct the contents of the edit buffer out to a shell operation (via a pipe) by using the left angle bracket (\">\"), followed by a \"!\" and the shell command to execute. The output of a shell operation can also be directed into the edit buffer by using a right angle bracket (\"<\") before the exclamation mark. These can even be used together to send output to a shell operation and read back the results into the editor. So, if the editor contained a list of words to be sorted, they could be sorted by typing the following at the command prompt: ><!sort This would send the contents of the editor to be piped into the sort utility and the result would be placed into the edit buffer at the current cursor location. The old information would have to be deleted by the user. Initializing ee from a file Since different users have different preferences, ee allows some slight configurability. There are three possible locations for an initialization file for ee: the file \/usr\/local\/lib\/init.ee, the file .init.ee in the user's home directory, or the file .init.ee in the current directory (if different from the home directory). This allows system administrators to set some preferences for the users on a system-wide basis (for example, the print command), and the user to customize settings for particular directories (like one for correspondence, and a different directory for programming). The file usr\/local\/lib\/init.ee is read first, then $HOME\/.init.ee, then .init.ee, with the settings specified by the most recent file read taking precedence. The following items may be entered in the initialization file: case Sets searches to be case sensitive. nocase Sets searches to be insensitive to case (default). expand Causes ee to expand tabs to spaces (default). noexpand Causes ee to insert tabs as a single character. info A small information window is displayed at the top of the terminal (default). noinfo Turns off the display of the information window. margins Causes ee to truncate lines at the right margin when the cursor passes beyond the right margin as set by the user while text is being inserted (default). nomargins Allows lines to extend beyond the right margin. autoformat Causes ee to automatically try to format the current paragraph while text insertion is occurring. noautoformat Turns off automatic paragraph formatting (default). printcommand Allows the setting of the print command (default: \"lp\"). rightmargin The user can select a value for the right margin (the first column on the screen is zero). highlight Turns on highlighting border of information window and menus (default). nohighlight Turns off highlighting of border of information window and menus. eightbit Turns on display of eight bit characters. noeightbit Turns off display of eight bit characters (they are displayed as their decimal value inside angle brackets, e.g., \"<220>\"). 16bit Turns on handling of 16-bit characters. no16bit Turns off handling of 16-bit characters. emacs Turns on emacs key bindings. noemacs Turns off emacs key bindings. Save Editor Configuration When using this entry from the settings menu, the user may choose to save the current configuration of the editor (see Initializing ee from a file above) to a file named .init.ee in the current directory or the user's home directory. If a file named .init.ee already exists, it will be renamed .init.ee.old.","Process Name":"ee","Link":"https:\/\/linux.die.net\/man\/1\/ee"}},{"Process":{"Description":"","Process Name":"efax","Link":"https:\/\/linux.die.net\/man\/1\/efax"}},{"Process":{"Description":"EffecTV is a real-time video effector.

Command-line options exist to override some of the directives found in the .cloginrc configuration file. The command-line options are as follows: -S Save the configuration on exit, if the device prompts at logout time. This only has affect when used with -s. -V Prints package name and version strings. -c Command to be run on each router list on the command-line. Multiple commands maybe listed by separating them with semi-colons (;). The argument should be quoted to avoid shell expansion. -d Enable expect debugging. -E Specifies a variable to pass through to scripts (-s). For example, the command-line option -Efoo=bar will produce a global variable by the name Efoo with the initial value \"bar\". -e Specify a password to be supplied when gaining enable privileges on the router(s). Also see the password directive of the .cloginrc file. -f Specifies an alternate configuration file. The default is $HOME\/.cloginrc. -p Specifies a password associated with the user specified by the -u option, user directive of the .cloginrc file, or the Unix username of the user. -s The filename of an expect(1) script which will be sourced after the login is successful and is expected to return control to clogin, with the connection to the router intact, when it is done. Note that clogin disables log_user of expect(1)when -s is used. Example script(s) can be found in share\/rancid\/*.exp. -t Alters the timeout interval; the period that clogin waits for an individual command to return a prompt or the login process to produce a prompt or failure. The argument is in seconds. -u Specifies the username used when prompted. The command-line option overrides any user directive found in .cloginrc. The default is the current Unix username. -v Specifies a vty password, that which is prompted for upon connection to the router.

The primary documentation of GNU Emacs is in the GNU Emacs Manual, which you can read using Info, either from Emacs or as a standalone program. Please look there for complete and up-to-date documentation. This man page is updated only when someone volunteers to do so; the Emacs maintainers' priority goal is to minimize the amount of time this man page takes away from other more useful projects. The user functionality of GNU Emacs encompasses everything other Emacs editors do, and it is easily extensible since its editing commands are written in Lisp. Emacs has an extensive interactive help facility, but the facility assumes that you know how to manipulate Emacs windows and buffers. CTRL-h or F1 enters the Help facility. Help Tutorial (CTRL-h t) starts an interactive tutorial which can teach beginners the fundamentals of Emacs in a few minutes. Help Apropos (CTRL-h a) helps you find a command given its functionality, Help Character (CTRL-h c) describes a given character's effect, and Help Function (CTRL-h f) describes a given Lisp function specified by name. Emacs's Undo can undo several steps of modification to your buffers, so it is easy to recover from editing mistakes. GNU Emacs's many special packages handle mail reading (RMail) and sending (Mail), outline editing (Outline), compiling (Compile), running subshells within Emacs windows (Shell), running a Lisp read-eval-print loop (Lisp-Interaction-Mode), automated psychotherapy (Doctor), and much more. There is an extensive reference manual, but users of other Emacses should have little trouble adapting even without a copy. Users new to Emacs will be able to use basic features fairly rapidly by studying the tutorial and using the self-documentation features. Emacs Options The following options are of general interest: file Edit file. --file file, --find-file file, --visit file The same as specifying file directly as an argument. + number Go to the line specified by number (do not insert a space between the \"+\" sign and the number). This applies only to the next file specified. + line:column Go to the specified line and column. -q, --no-init-file Do not load an init file. --no-site-file Do not load the site-wide startup file. --no-desktop Do not load a saved desktop. -nl, --no-shared-memory Do not use shared memory. -Q, --quick Equivalent to \"-q --no-site-file --no-splash\". --no-splash Do not display a splash screen during start-up. --debug-init Enable Emacs Lisp debugger during the processing of the user init file ~\/.emacs. This is useful for debugging problems in the init file. -u user, --user user Load user's init file. -t file, --terminal file Use specified file as the terminal instead of using stdin\/stdout. This must be the first argument specified in the command line. --multibyte, --no-unibyte Enable multibyte mode (enabled by default). --unibyte, --no-multibyte Enable unibyte mode. --version Display Emacs version information and exit. --help Display this help and exit. The following options are lisp-oriented (these options are processed in the order encountered): -f function, --funcall function Execute the lisp function function. -l file, --load file Load the lisp code in the file file. --eval expr, --execute expr Evaluate the Lisp expression expr. The following options are useful when running Emacs as a batch editor: --batch Edit in batch mode. The editor will send messages to stderr. This option must be the first in the argument list. You must use -l and -f options to specify files to execute and functions to call. --script file Run file as an Emacs Lisp script. --insert file Insert contents of file into the current buffer. --kill Exit Emacs while in batch mode. -L dir, --directory dir Add dir to the list of directories Emacs searches for Lisp files. Using Emacs with X Emacs has been tailored to work well with the X window system. If you run Emacs from under X windows, it will create its own X window to display in. You will probably want to start the editor as a background process so that you can continue using your original window. Emacs can be started with the following X switches: --name name Specify the name which should be assigned to the initial Emacs window. This controls looking up X resources as well as the window title. -T name, --title name Specify the title for the initial X window. -r, -rv, --reverse-video Display the Emacs window in reverse video. -fn font, --font font Set the Emacs window's font to that specified by font. You will find the various X fonts in the \/usr\/lib\/X11\/fonts directory. Note that Emacs will only accept fixed width fonts. Under the X11 Release 4 font-naming conventions, any font with the value \"m\" or \"c\" in the eleventh field of the font name is a fixed width font. Furthermore, fonts whose name are of the form widthx height are generally fixed width, as is the font fixed. See xlsfonts(1) for more information. When you specify a font, be sure to put a space between the switch and the font name. --xrm resources Set additional X resources. --color, --color= mode Override color mode for character terminals; mode defaults to 'auto', and can also be 'never', 'auto', 'always', or a mode name like 'ansi8'. -bw pixels, --border-width pixels Set the Emacs window's border width to the number of pixels specified by pixels. Defaults to one pixel on each side of the window. -ib pixels, --internal-border pixels Set the window's internal border width to the number of pixels specified by pixels. Defaults to one pixel of padding on each side of the window. -g geometry, --geometry geometry Set the Emacs window's width, height, and position as specified. The geometry specification is in the standard X format; see x(7) for more information. The width and height are specified in characters; the default is 80 by 24. See the Emacs manual, section \"Options for Window Size and Position\", for information on how window sizes interact with selecting or deselecting the tool bar and menu bar. -lsp pixels, --line-spacing pixels Additional space to put between lines. -vb, --vertical-scroll-bars Enable vertical scrollbars. -fh, --fullheight Make the first frame as high as the screen. -fs, --fullscreen Make the first frame fullscreen. -fw, --fullwidth Make the first frame as wide as the screen. -fg color, --foreground-color color On color displays, set the color of the text. Use the command M-x list-colors-display for a list of valid color names. -bg color, --background-color color On color displays, set the color of the window's background. -bd color, --border-color color On color displays, set the color of the window's border. -cr color, --cursor-color color On color displays, set the color of the window's text cursor. -ms color, --mouse-color color On color displays, set the color of the window's mouse cursor. -d displayname, --display displayname Create the Emacs window on the display specified by displayname. Must be the first option specified in the command line. -nbi, --no-bitmap-icon Do not use picture of gnu for Emacs icon. --iconic Start Emacs in iconified state. -nbc, --no-blinking-cursor Disable blinking cursor. -nw, --no-window-system Tell Emacs not to use its special interface to X. If you use this switch when invoking Emacs from an xterm(1) window, display is done in that window. -D, --basic-display This option disables many display features; use it for debugging Emacs. You can set X default values for your Emacs windows in your .Xresources file (see xrdb(1)). Use the following format: emacs. keyword: value where value specifies the default value of keyword. Emacs lets you set default values for the following keywords: background (class Background) For color displays, sets the window's background color. bitmapIcon (class BitmapIcon) If bitmapIcon's value is set to on, the window will iconify into the \"kitchen sink.\" borderColor (class BorderColor) For color displays, sets the color of the window's border. borderWidth (class BorderWidth) Sets the window's border width in pixels. cursorColor (class Foreground) For color displays, sets the color of the window's text cursor. cursorBlink (class CursorBlink) Specifies whether to make the cursor blink. The default is on. Use off or false to turn cursor blinking off. font (class Font) Sets the window's text font. foreground (class Foreground) For color displays, sets the window's text color. fullscreen (class Fullscreen) The desired fullscreen size. The value can be one of fullboth, fullwidth, or fullheight, which correspond to the command-line options '-fs', '-fw', and '-fh', respectively. Note that this applies to the initial frame only. geometry (class Geometry) Sets the geometry of the Emacs window (as described above). iconName (class Title) Sets the icon name for the Emacs window icon. internalBorder (class BorderWidth) Sets the window's internal border width in pixels. lineSpacing (class LineSpacing) Additional space (\"leading\") between lines, in pixels. menuBar (class MenuBar) Gives frames menu bars if on; don't have menu bars if off. See the Emacs manual, sections \"Lucid Resources\" and \"LessTif Resources\", for how to control the appearance of the menu bar if you have one. minibuffer (class Minibuffer) If none, don't make a minibuffer in this frame. It will use a separate minibuffer frame instead. paneFont (class Font) Font name for menu pane titles, in non-toolkit versions of Emacs. pointerColor (class Foreground) For color displays, sets the color of the window's mouse cursor. privateColormap (class PrivateColormap) If on, use a private color map, in the case where the \"default visual\" of class PseudoColor and Emacs is using it. reverseVideo (class ReverseVideo) If reverseVideo's value is set to on, the window will be displayed in reverse video. screenGamma (class ScreenGamma) Gamma correction for colors, equivalent to the frame parameter 'screen-gamma'. scrollBarWidth (class ScrollBarWidth) The scroll bar width in pixels, equivalent to the frame parameter 'scroll-bar-width'. selectionFont (class SelectionFont) Font name for pop-up menu items, in non-toolkit versions of Emacs. (For toolkit versions, see the Emacs manual, sections \"Lucid Resources\" and \"LessTif Resources\".) selectionTimeout (class SelectionTimeout) Number of milliseconds to wait for a selection reply. A value of 0 means wait as long as necessary. synchronous (class Synchronous) Run Emacs in synchronous mode if on. Synchronous mode is useful for debugging X problems. title (class Title) Sets the title of the Emacs window. toolBar (class ToolBar) Number of lines to reserve for the tool bar. useXIM (class UseXIM) Turns off use of X input methods (XIM) if false or off. verticalScrollBars (class ScrollBars) Gives frames scroll bars if on; suppresses scroll bars if off. visualClass (class VisualClass) Specify the \"visual\" that X should use. This tells X how to handle colors. The value should start with one of TrueColor, PseudoColor, DirectColor, StaticColor, GrayScale, and StaticGray, followed by - depth, where depth is the number of color planes. If you try to set color values while using a black and white display, the window's characteristics will default as follows: the foreground color will be set to black, the background color will be set to white, the border color will be set to grey, and the text and mouse cursors will be set to black. Using the Mouse The following lists some of the mouse button bindings for the Emacs window under X11. MOUSE BUTTON FUNCTION left Set point. middle Paste text. right Cut text into X cut buffer.

Full documentation is available in the GNU Info format; see below. This manual page was originally written for the Debian GNU\/Linux distribution, but is not specific to that system. emacsclient works in conjunction with the built-in Emacs server. You can either call emacsclient directly or let other programs run it for you when necessary. On GNU and Unix systems many programs consult the environment variable EDITOR (sometimes also VISUAL) to obtain the command used for editing. Thus, setting this environment variable to 'emacsclient' will allow these programs to use an already running Emacs for editing. Other operating systems might have their own methods for defining the default editor. For emacsclient to work, you need an already running Emacs with a server. Within Emacs, call the functions 'server-start' or 'server-mode'. (Your '.emacs' file can do this automatically if you add either '(server-start)' or '(server-mode 1)' to it.) When you've finished editing the buffer, type 'C-x #' ('server-edit'). This saves the file and sends a message back to the 'emacsclient' program telling it to exit. The programs that use 'EDITOR' wait for the \"editor\" (actually, 'emacsclient') to exit. 'C-x #' also checks for other pending external requests to edit various files, and selects the next such file. If you set the variable 'server-window' to a window or a frame, 'C-x #' displays the server buffer in that window or in that frame.","Process Name":"emacsclient","Link":"https:\/\/linux.die.net\/man\/1\/emacsclient"}},{"Process":{"Description":"Email is a command line email client similiar to 'mailx'. Added features make this a more advanced client for sending email via the command line. Email works with sendmail, just as 'mailx' does, but email also allows sending to remote smtp servers for your email delivery. It also works with GPG for encrypting and signing the emails on the fly. Email also incorporates a few other features as well. These features include signature files with wildcard options to specify the data, time, day, version, system, and even a 'fortune' with the help of the 'fortune' command. Email also supports a very configurable address book. This way you can specify a persons name with an email address and also place a group of names into one group for sending. Email also supports attachments. It will accept N attachments via a command line option and encode them with Base64 before sending them with the email. Email works with a configuration file named email.conf which is found in \/etc\/email\/email.conf although can be changed by specifying the --sysconfdir option during the .\/configure. If you do not have or want a configuration file, you can specify the -r option to specify your smtp server and this will allow you to bypass using a configuration file and use default values. If you specify the -r option (listed below) and you do have a configuration file, it will still use the configuration file but override the SMTP_SERVER variable with what is used at the command line.","Process Name":"email","Link":"https:\/\/linux.die.net\/man\/1\/email"}},{"Process":{"Description":"emerald emerald is the windows decorator of the beryl project.","Process Name":"emerald","Link":"https:\/\/linux.die.net\/man\/1\/emerald"}},{"Process":{"Description":"emerald-theme-manager is the theme manager of emerald. . $HOME\/.emerald\/settings.ini Here are the settings stored.","Process Name":"emerald-theme-manager","Link":"https:\/\/linux.die.net\/man\/1\/emerald-theme-manager"}},{"Process":{"Description":"","Process Name":"emit","Link":"https:\/\/linux.die.net\/man\/1\/emit"}},{"Process":{"Description":"","Process Name":"enable","Link":"https:\/\/linux.die.net\/man\/1\/enable"}},{"Process":{"Description":"Enblend overlays multiple TIFF images using the Burt & Adelson multiresolution spline. This technique tries to make the seams between the input images invisible. The basic idea is that image features should be blended across a transition zone proportional in size to the spatial frequency of the features. For example, objects like trees and windowpanes have rapid changes in color. By blending these features in a narrow zone, you will not be able to see the seam because the eye already expects to see color changes at the edge of these features. Clouds and sky are the opposite. These features have to be blended across a wide transition zone because any sudden change in color will be immediately noticeable. Enblend expects each input TIFF to have an alpha channel. The alpha channel should indicate the region of the file that has valid image data. Enblend compares the alpha regions in the input files to find the areas where images overlap. Alpha channels can be used to indicate to Enblend that certain portions of an input image should not contribute to the final image. Enblend does not align images for you. Use a tool like Hugin or PanoTools to do this. The TIFFs produced by these programs are exactly what enblend is designed to work with. Sometimes these GUIs allow you to select feathering for the edges of your images. This treatment is detrimental to Enblend. Turn off feathering by deselecting it or setting the feather width to zero. Enblend blends the images in the order you specify on the command line. You should order your images according to the way that they overlap, for example from left-to-right across the panorama. If you are making a multi-row panorama, I recommend blending each horizontal row individually, and then running Enblend a final time to blend all of the rows together vertically.","Process Name":"enblend","Link":"https:\/\/linux.die.net\/man\/1\/enblend"}},{"Process":{"Description":"The symmetric cipher commands allow data to be encrypted or decrypted using various block and stream ciphers using keys based on passwords or explicitly provided.

Some things you want to keep in mind: 1) If you want to stream video frames (using video_pattern = \"-\") you have to make sure that there is no trailing garbage at the end of the pictures. This is ignored by most image manipulation programs! 2) If you are one of the poor persons with a buggy PCI bus-mastering board be sure to have a backup handy if you want to use video support. Some versions of the VIA board chipsets crash your machine and even your harddisk. Since encodedv uses full resolution capturing it is more likely to trigger these bugs than other programs. If you have a VIA board you definitely want to upgrade to Linux 2.4.3 or higher. 3) The encoded pictures must have the correct resolution. If they don't, you may want to try ppmqscale. The used video format is chosen by picture resolution. Use 720x576 for PAL and 720x480 for NTSC. 4) If you want to speed up things a little bit and you are generating the input pictures automatically you may want to try pgm's instead of ppm's since they are encoded somewhat faster.

The job of the epmd daemon is to keep track of which node name listens on which address. Hence, epmd map symbolic node names to machine addresses. The TCP\/IP epmd daemon actually only keeps track of the Name (first) part of an Erlang node name, the Host part (whatever is after the @ is implicit in the node name where the epmd daemon was actually contacted, as is the IP address where the Erlang node can be reached.

When neither -f nor -s is specified, input and output variables must be mutually exclusive. If the -s option is given, an output variable may be used in an expression defining another output variable: the expression for the first output is substituted for the the name of that output when it is encountered. The -f option allows outputs to be defined in terms of their previous values in a synchronous system (e.g. an FSM): the same name appearing as both an input and an output may be thought of as referring to two distinct variables, or the same variable at two distinct times. (The -f and -s options are mutually exclusive.) If the -r option is specified, eqntott will attempt to reduce the size of the truth table by merging minterms. The -R option (implies -r) forces eqntott to produce a truth table with no redundant minterms. The truth table generated does not represent a minimal covering of the truth functions, but does preserve some ''don't care'' information for some other program to use. If the -l option is specified, eqntott will output a truth table which includes the name of the pla and its inputs and outputs as specified in PLA(5). The form that the output takes is controlled by the string key, described below.

The emulator started in this way can be manipulated through the Windows(R) services applet in a manner similar to other services. As well as being the actual service, erlsrv also provides a command line interface for registering, changing, starting and stopping services. To manipulate services, the logged in user should have Administrator privileges on the machine. The Erlang machine itself is (default) run as the local administrator. This can be changed with the Services applet in Windows (R). The processes created by the service can, as opposed to normal services, be \"killed\" with the task manager. Killing a emulator that is started by a service will trigger the \"OnFail\" action specified for that service, which may be a reboot. The following parameters may be specified for each Erlang service: * StopAction: This tells erlsrv how to stop the Erlang emulator. Default is to kill it (Win32 TerminateProcess), but this action can specify any Erlang shell command that will be executed in the emulator to make it stop. The emulator is expected to stop within 30 seconds after the command is issued in the shell. If the emulator is not stopped, it will report a running state to the service manager. * OnFail: This can be either of reboot, restart, restart_always or ignore (the default). In case of reboot, the NT system is rebooted whenever the emulator stops (a more simple form of watchdog), this could be useful for less critical systems, otherwise use the heart functionality to accomplish this. The restart value makes the Erlang emulator be restarted (with whatever parameters are registered for the service at the occasion) when it stops. If the emulator stops again within 10 seconds, it is not restarted to avoid an infinite loop which could completely hang the NT system. restart_always is similar to restart, but does not try to detect cyclic restarts, it is expected that some other mechanism is present to avoid the problem. The default (ignore) just reports the service as stopped to the service manager whenever it fails, it has to be manually restarted. On a system where release handling is used, this should always be set to ignore. Use heart to restart the service on failure instead. * Machine: The location of the Erlang emulator. The default is the erl.exe located in the same directory as erlsrv.exe. Do not specify werl.exe as this emulator, it will not work. If the system uses release handling, this should be set to a program similar to start_erl.exe. * Env: Specifies an additional environment for the emulator. The environment variables specified here are added to the system wide environment block that is normally present when a service starts up. Variables present in both the system wide environment and in the service environment specification will be set to the value specified in the service. * WorkDir: The working directory for the Erlang emulator, has to be on a local drive (there are no network drives mounted when a service starts). Default working directory for services is %SystemDrive%%SystemPath%. Debug log files will be placed in this directory. * Priority: The process priority of the emulator, this can be one of realtime, high, low or default (the default). Real-time priority is not recommended, the machine will possibly be inaccessible to interactive users. High priority could be used if two Erlang nodes should reside on one dedicated system and one should have precedence over the other. Low process priority may be used if interactive performance should not be affected by the emulator process. * SName or Name: Specifies the short or long node-name of the Erlang emulator. The Erlang services are always distributed, default is to use the service name as (short) node-name. * DebugType: Can be one of none (default), new, reuse or console. Specifies that output from the Erlang shell should be sent to a \"debug log\". The log file is named <servicename> .debug or <servicename> .debug.<N>, where <N> is an integer between 1 and 99. The log-file is placed in the working directory of the service (as specified in WorkDir). The reuse option always reuses the same log file (<servicename> .debug) and the new option uses a separate log file for every invocation of the service (<servicename> .debug.<N>). The console option opens an interactive Windows(R) console window for the Erlang shell of the service. The console option automatically disables the StopAction and a service started with an interactive console window will not survive logouts, OnFail actions do not work with debug-consoles either. If no DebugType is specified ( none), the output of the Erlang shell is discarded. The consoleDebugType is not in any way intended for production. It is only a convenient way to debug Erlang services during development. The new and reuse options might seem convenient to have in a production system, but one has to take into account that the logs will grow indefinitely during the systems lifetime and there is no way, short of restarting the service, to truncate those logs. In short, the DebugType is intended for debugging only. Logs during production are better produced with the standard Erlang logging facilities. * Args: Additional arguments passed to the emulator startup program erl.exe (or start_erl.exe). Arguments that cannot be specified here are -noinput (StopActions would not work), -name and -sname (they are specified in any way. The most common use is for specifying cookies and flags to be passed to init:boot() ( -s). The naming of the service in a system that uses release handling has to follow the convention NodeName_Release, where NodeName is the first part of the Erlang nodename (up to, but not including the \"@\") and Release is the current release of the application.","Process Name":"erlsrv","Link":"https:\/\/linux.die.net\/man\/1\/erlsrv"}},{"Process":{"Description":null,"Process Name":"errstr","Link":"https:\/\/linux.die.net\/man\/1\/errstr"}},{"Process":{"Description":"eruby interprets a Ruby code embedded text file.

If the file argument has no extension, \".tex\" will be appended to it. Instead of a filename, a set of e-TeX commands can be given, the first of which must start with a backslash. With a &format argument e-TeX uses a different set of precompiled commands, contained in format.fmt; it is usually better to use the -fmt format option instead. e-TeX is the first concrete result of an international research & development project, the NTS Project, which was established under the aegis of DANTE e.V. during 1992. The aims of the project are to perpetuate and develop the spirit and philosophy of TeX, whilst respecting Knuth's wish that TeX should remain frozen. e-TeX can be used in two different modes: in compatibility mode it is supposed to be completely interchangable with standard TeX. In extended mode several new primitives are added that facilitate (among other things) bidirectional typesetting. An extended mode format is generated by prefixing the name of the source file for the format with an asterisk (*). Such formats are often prefixed with an 'e', hence etex as the extended version of tex and elatex as the extended version of latex. However, eplain is an exception to this rule. The einitex and evirtex commands are e-TeX's analogues to the initex and virtex commands. In this installation, they are symbolic links to the etex executable. These symbolic links may not exist at all. e-TeX's handling of its command-line arguments is similar to that of the other TeX programs in the web2c implementation.","Process Name":"etex","Link":"https:\/\/linux.die.net\/man\/1\/etex"}},{"Process":{"Description":"EtherApe is a network traffic browser.

If the file argument has no extension, \".tex\" will be appended to it. Instead of a filename, a set of e-TeX commands can be given, the first of which must start with a backslash. With a &format argument e-TeX uses a different set of precompiled commands, contained in format.fmt; it is usually better to use the -fmt format option instead. e-TeX is the first concrete result of an international research & development project, the NTS Project, which was established under the aegis of DANTE e.V. during 1992. The aims of the project are to perpetuate and develop the spirit and philosophy of TeX, whilst respecting Knuth's wish that TeX should remain frozen. e-TeX can be used in two different modes: in compatibility mode it is supposed to be completely interchangable with standard TeX. In extended mode several new primitives are added that facilitate (among other things) bidirectional typesetting. An extended mode format is generated by prefixing the name of the source file for the format with an asterisk (*). Such formats are often prefixed with an 'e', hence etex as the extended version of tex and elatex as the extended version of latex. However, eplain is an exception to this rule. The einitex and evirtex commands are e-TeX's analogues to the initex and virtex commands. In this installation, they are symbolic links to the etex executable. These symbolic links may not exist at all. e-TeX's handling of its command-line arguments is similar to that of the other TeX programs in the web2c implementation.","Process Name":"evirtex","Link":"https:\/\/linux.die.net\/man\/1\/evirtex"}},{"Process":{"Description":null,"Process Name":"ewfacquire","Link":"https:\/\/linux.die.net\/man\/1\/ewfacquire"}},{"Process":{"Description":null,"Process Name":"ewfacquirestream","Link":"https:\/\/linux.die.net\/man\/1\/ewfacquirestream"}},{"Process":{"Description":"ewfexport is a utility to export media data stored in EWF files. ewfexport is part of the libewf package. libewf is a library to support the Expert Witness Compression Format (EWF). libewf supports both the SMART format (EWF-S01) and the EnCase format (EWF-E01). libewf currently does not support the Logical Volume format (EWF-L01).

Preamble The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program -- to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify it. For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations. To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work. A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code. The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work. A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 2. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\". c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms. \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents. A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\". A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND\/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. < one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does. > Copyright © < year > < name of author > This program is free software: you can redistribute it and\/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

See the GNU General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see <http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/>. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: <program> Copyright © <year> <name of author> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type \"show w\". This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type \"show c\" for details. The hypothetical commands \"show w\" and \"show c\" should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\". You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.

The root of the tree to be extracted is the file root.ext; it and all the files it references are recursively flattened. The result is a single, flat representation of the circuit that is written to the file root.spice . The following options are recognized: -o outfile Instead of leaving output in the file root .spice, leave it in outfile. -B Don't output transistor or node attributes in the spice file. Usually the attributes of a node or a device are output as special comments **fetattr and **nodeatrr which can be processed further to create things such a initial conditions etc. -F Don't output nodes that aren't connected to fets (floating nodes). Normally capacitance from these nodes is output with the comment **FLOATING attached on the same line. -tchar Trim characters from node names when writing the output file. Char should be either \"#\" or \"!\". The option may be used twice if both characters are desired. Trimming \"#\" and \"!\" is enabled by default when the format is hspice. -M|m Merge parallel fets. -m means conservative merging of fets that have equal widths only (usefull with hspice format multiplier if delta W effects need to be taken care of). -M means aggresive merging: the fets are merged if they have the same terminals and the same length. -y num Select the precision for outputing capacitors. The default is 1 which means that the capacitors will be printed to a precision of .1 fF. -f hspice|spice2|spice3 Select the output format. Spice3 is the the format understood by the latest version of berkeley spice. Node names have the same names as they would in a sim(5) file and no special constructs are used. Spice2 is the format understood by the older version of spice (which usually has better convergence). Node names are numbers and a dictionary of number and corresponding node is output in the end. HSPICE is a format understood by meta-software's hspice and other commercial tools. In this format node names cannot be longer than 15 characters long (blame the fortran code): so if a hierarchical node name is longer it is truncated to something like x1234\/name where x1234 is an alias of the normal node hierarchical prefix and name its hierarchical postfix (a dictionary mapping prefixes to real hierarchical paths is output at the end of the spice file). If the node name is still longer than 15 characters long (again blame the fortran code) it is translated to something like z@1234 and the equivalent name is output as a comment. In addition since hspice supports scaling and multipliers so the output dimensions are in lambdas and if parallel fets are merged the hspice construct M is used. -J hier|flat Select the source\/drain area and perimeter extraction algorithm. If hier is selected then the areas and perimeters are extracted only within each subcell. For each fet in a subcell the area and perimeter of its source and drain within this subcell are output. If two or more fets share a source\/drain node then the total area and perimeter will be output in only one of them and the other will have 0. If flat is selected the same rules apply only that the scope of search for area and perimeter is the whole netlist. In general flat (which is the default) will give accurate results (it will take into account shared sources\/drains) but hier is provided for backwards compatibility with version 6.4.5. On top of this selection you can individually control how a terminal of a specific fet will be extracted if you put a source\/drain attribute. ext:aph makes the extraction for that specific terminal hierarchical and ext:apf makes the extraction flat (see the magic tutorial about attaching attribute labels). Additionaly to ease extraction of bipolar transistors the gate attribute ext:aps forces the output of the substrate area and perimeter for a specific fet (in flat mode only). -j device:sdRclass[\/subRclass]\/defaultSubstrate Gives ext2sim information about the source\/drain resistance class of the fet type device. Makes device to have sdRclass source drain resistance class, subRclass substrate (well) resistance class and the node named defaultSubstrate as its default substrate. The defaults are nfet:0\/Gnd and pfet:1\/6\/Vdd which correspond to the MOSIS technology file but things might vary in your site. Ask your local cad administrator. The way the extraction of node area and perimeter works in magic the total area and perimeter of the source\/drain junction is summed up on a single node. That is why all the junction areas and perimeters are summed up on a single node (this should not affect simulation results however). Special care must be taken when the substrate of a fet is tied to a node other than the default substrate (eg in a bootstraping charge pump). To get the correct substrate info in these cases the fet(s) with separate wells should be in their own separate subcell with ext:aph attributes attached to their sensitive terminals (also all the transistors which share sensistive terminals with these should be in another subcell with the same attributes). In addition, all of the options of extcheck(1) are accepted. The awk filter spice2sim is provided with the current distribution for debugging purposes.","Process Name":"ext2spice","Link":"https:\/\/linux.die.net\/man\/1\/ext2spice"}},{"Process":{"Description":"Extcheck will read an extracted circuit in the hierarchical ext(5) representation produced by Magic, check to ensure that all global nodes (those to which a label ending in an exclamantion point is attached) are fully connected in the layout, and then print a count of the number of various items (nodes, fets, etc) encountered while flattening the circuit. The root of the tree to be processed is the file root.ext; it and all the files it references are recursively flattened. The following options are recognized: -c cthresh Set the capacitance threshold to cthresh femtofarads. Extcheck will count the number of explicit internodal capacitors greater than cthresh, the number of nodes whose capacitance is greater than cthresh, as well as the total number of nodes. (Other programs such as ext2sim(1) use this option as a threshold value below which a capacitor will not be output). The default value for cthresh is 10 femtofarads. -p path Normally, the path to search for .ext files is determined by looking for path commands in first ~cad\/lib\/magic\/sys\/.magic, then ~\/.magic, then .magic in the current directory. If -p is specified, the colon-separated list of directories specified by path is used instead. Each of these directories is searched in turn for the .ext files in a design. -r rthresh Set the resistance threshold to rthresh ohms. Similar in function to -c, but for resistances. The default value for rthresh is 10 ohms. -s sym=value It's possible to use special attributes attached to transistor gates to control the length and width of transistors explicitly, rather than allowing them to be determined by the extractor. These attributes are of the form ext:w=width^ or ext:l=length^, where width or length can either be numeric, or textual. (The trailing '' ^'' indicates that these are transistor gate attributes). If textual, they are treated as symbols which can be assigned a numeric value at the time ext2sim is run. The -s flag is used to assign numeric values to symbols. If a textual symbol appears in one of the above attributes, but isn't given a numeric value via -s (or -S below), then it is ignored; otherwise, the transistor's length or width is set to the numeric value defined for that symbol. (This option is not currently used by extcheck, but it is common to ext2sim(1) and other tools that are written using the extflat(3) library) -C Set the capacitance threshold to infinity. Because this avoids any internodal capacitance processing, all tools will run faster when this flag is given. -R Set the resistance threshold to infinity. -S symfile Each line in the file symfile is of the form sym=value, just like the argument to the -s flag above; the lines are interpreted in the same fashion. (This option is not currently used by extcheck, but it is common to ext2sim et. al.) -T tech Set the technology in the output .sim file to tech. This overrides any technology specified in the root .ext file.","Process Name":"extcheck","Link":"https:\/\/linux.die.net\/man\/1\/extcheck"}},{"Process":{"Description":"The extcheck utility checks a specified Jar file for title and version conflicts with any extensions installed in the Java(TM) SDK.
