[{"Process":{"Description":"This program is part of Netpbm(1). 411toppm reads a .411 file, such as from a Sony Mavic camera, and converts it to a PPM image as output. Output is to Standard Output. The originator of this program and decipherer of the .411 format, Steve Allen <sla@alumni.caltech.edu>, has this to say about the utility of this program: 'There's so little image in a 64x48 thumbnail (especially when you have the full size JPG file) that the only point in doing this was to answer the implicit challenge posed by the manual stating that only the camera can use these files.'","Process Name":"411toppm","Link":"https:\/\/linux.die.net\/man\/1\/411toppm"}}]
